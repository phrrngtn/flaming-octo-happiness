Here's what i'm using


[Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit/index.php) for watching all the code and compiling everything anytime something changes. Particularly useful with includes for LESS or SASS. But also useable with CoffeeScript, JavaScript minification and so forth

[Tower](http://www.git-tower.com) this is by far the best UI i have found for git. i've bought GitBox and tried the GitHub Mac client too, and used the command line. 

[VirtualHostX](http://clickontyler.com/virtualhostx/) such a lovely tool so nice to be able to whip up a new local website in a matter of seconds

Editing: i use [Espresso](http://www.macrabbit.com/espresso/) but i can't honestly say if it's better than Sublime Text or Coda. I use it because i used CSSEdit which is now a part of espresso and i find that to be essential for what i do. I will say that if you are typing HTML AT ALL you need to be using [zen coding](http://docs.emmet.io) which is supported by all these editors. 

i use iTerm2 FWIW, very minor improvement over basic terminal (tabs, essentially)

i use a plugin for the finder called Go2Shell

i use MAMP so that i can run Wordpress on mySQL but that prolly won't matter to you

i use Safari with Developer tools enabled (preferences->Advanced tab->tickbox on bottom)

i use Firefox with Firebug plugin when i really need to debug JS and AJAX
